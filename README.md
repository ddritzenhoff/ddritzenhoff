## Yo! ğŸ‘‹

Currently a candidate for a Master's in Computer Science from the Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen (2023 - 2025) and recently completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from Northeastern University (2018 - 2022). I just want to be excited by technology and circumnavigate the globe by sailboat.
